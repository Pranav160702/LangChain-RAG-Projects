    "    Narendra Modi's speech on May 26, 2014, after being sworn in as the Prime Minister of India for the first time, is one of the most significant and iconic addresses in modern Indian history. This speech, delivered at the Central Hall of Parliament, came at a pivotal moment, as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had just won a resounding mandate in the general elections, marking a shift in the Indian political landscape. Modi's address was not just a speech; it was a declaration of his vision for India, a vision that would guide his government and the nation in the years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "    From the outset, Modi's speech was marked by a tone of optimism, inclusiveness, and determination. He emphasized that his government would focus on development and governance, moving away from the divisive and often fractious politics that had characterized much of the previous decades. Modi's mantra, \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\" (Together with all, development for all), which he introduced in this speech, became the defining slogan of his government. This phrase encapsulated his vision of inclusive growth, where every section of society, regardless of caste, creed, or religion, would benefit from the nation's progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modi's emphasis on development was not just a rhetorical flourish; it was the cornerstone of his political ideology. He spoke of the need to create a government that works for the common man, one that is responsive to the needs of the poor, the marginalized, and the underprivileged. In his speech, he highlighted the importance of good governance, stating that his administration would be focused on efficiency, transparency, and accountability. This was a clear departure from the past, where government inefficiency and corruption had often hampered India's development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    One of the most striking aspects of Modi's speech was his vision of India as a global power. He articulated a roadmap for India's economic transformation, emphasizing the need for economic reforms, infrastructure development, and technological advancement. Modi spoke of making India a manufacturing hub, creating jobs, and attracting foreign investment. He envisioned an India that was not just self-reliant but also a leader on the global stage, contributing to global peace, security, and prosperity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modi's speech also touched upon the aspirations of the Indian people, particularly the youth. He acknowledged that India was a young nation, with a large and dynamic population that was eager for change and progress. Modi promised that his government would work tirelessly to create opportunities for the youth, enabling them to realize their full potential. He spoke of the importance of skill development, education, and entrepreneurship in empowering the youth and driving the nation's economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Throughout his speech, Modi reaffirmed his commitment to democracy and the values enshrined in the Indian Constitution. He spoke of his deep respect for India's democratic traditions and institutions, emphasizing that his government would uphold these values while working to strengthen the nation's democratic fabric. Modi's commitment to democracy was also reflected in his call for cooperation and collaboration among all political parties. He urged the opposition to work with the government in the spirit of constructive criticism, to ensure that the government remained accountable and responsive to the needs of the people.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another key theme in Modi's speech was the idea of government accountability. He assured the nation that his government would be one that listens to the people, responds to their concerns, and delivers on its promises. Modi emphasized that transparency and efficiency would be the hallmarks of his administration, and that his government would take decisive action against corruption and malpractices. He spoke of the need to restore the people's faith in the government and the political system, which had been eroded by years of inefficiency and corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modi's speech was not just about policy and governance; it was also about the emotions and aspirations of the Indian people. He spoke directly to the hearts of millions of Indians who had placed their faith in him and his party. Modi's words were filled with humility, as he acknowledged the enormous responsibility that had been placed on his shoulders. He spoke of his own journey from humble beginnings to the highest office in the land, a journey that resonated with many Indians who saw in Modi a reflection of their own struggles and aspirations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In his speech, Modi also addressed the international community, signaling his intent to build strong and mutually beneficial relationships with other nations. He spoke of India's role in the world, not just as a regional power but as a global player. Modi emphasized that India would pursue a foreign policy that was driven by national interest but also guided by the principles of peace, cooperation, and mutual respect. He spoke of strengthening India's ties with its neighbors, deepening its engagement with the global community, and playing a proactive role in addressing global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, and economic inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modi's speech on May 26, 2014, was more than just a political address; it was a blueprint for his vision of a new India. It was a speech that captured the hopes and aspirations of a billion people, a speech that promised to usher in an era of transformation and progress. For many Indians, Modi's words represented a break from the past, a promise of a better future where the government would be responsive, efficient, and accountable, where every citizen would have the opportunity to thrive and succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The speech was also a reflection of Modi's leadership style—decisive, visionary, and inclusive. It set the tone for his government, which would go on to implement a series of bold reforms and initiatives aimed at transforming India into a modern, prosperous, and powerful nation. From the ambitious \"Make in India\" campaign to the groundbreaking Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform, Modi's government sought to reshape India's economic and political landscape in line with the vision he articulated in his 2014 speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the years since that speech, Modi has continued to invoke the themes of development, good governance, and inclusiveness in his addresses to the nation. His leadership has been marked by a relentless focus on delivering results, whether in the form of economic reforms, infrastructure development, or social welfare programs. The speech remains a touchstone for understanding Modi's approach to governance and his vision for India.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Narendra Modi's speech on May 26, 2014, will be remembered as a defining moment in India's political history. It was a speech that captured the imagination of a nation, a speech that laid the foundation for a new era of governance and development. Modi's words continue to resonate with millions of Indians who see in him a leader who is committed to building a stronger, more prosperous, and more inclusive India. The speech not only set the tone for Modi's tenure as Prime Minister but also for the direction in which India would move in the years to come.\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot proj ect on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

The speaker notes that providing physical connectivity through quality roads is crucial for faster movement of products from villages to markets. They also highlight the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which is providing urban amenities in rural areas through a PURA complex involving 65 villages.

      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) program in generating employment and creating entrepreneurs in the Periyar village. The program involved the development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivatable land, where villagers are now growing crops like Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, generating power using biomass, processing food, and running marketing centers. The program has created a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",

      "\n",
      "The speaker is sharing two enriching experiences they had.

The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and empowering farmers to protect the land for a second green revolution. They expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships with farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience was meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who was full of joy and confidence. Despite his physical limitations, he thanked God, his parents, and others for giving him the ability to overcome his circumstances. When asked what he needed, he replied that he wanted to sing in front of the speaker, which showed his resilience and determination to pursue his passions despite adversity.\n",
      "\n",

The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a young man who sang in front of him, and the message is that with a positive attitude and perseverance, people can overcome their limitations and achieve their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the theme of overcoming the impact of disasters through partnership. The speaker shares their experience visiting a village in Jammu and Kashmir that was affected by an earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and loss, the villagers were able to bounce back and rebuild their community with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government. The speaker praises the courage and resilience of the people of Urusa village, who were able to overcome their problems and become masters of their own destiny.\n",

      "\n",
      "The author also shares a personal experience from their visit to the Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met tribal council leaders and children who had been affected by the 2004 Tsunami.

The project will connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, and 53 telemedicine and education centers in Africa, with a pilot project already launched in Ethiopia. The goal is to facilitate tele-education and tele-medicine services, with examples including an MBA course for Ethiopian students and telemedicine services provided by specialists from India.\n",
      "\n",

      "The speaker is talking about a foundation called Lead India 2020, which is transforming young students into enlightened citizens. The foundation, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, is working in partnership with district administrations in Andhra Pradesh to train thousands of students. The speaker shares examples of the positive impact of the training on students, including increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. One student, Ms. Padma, even helped her father quit smoking after completing the training.
