# LangChain & RAG Projects
This repository contains multiple projects utilizing LangChain and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques, integrated with various tools and APIs for natural language processing, search, and summarization tasks. Below is a description of each project:

1. Q&A Chatbot
Directory: 01_Q&A Chatbot
- This project builds a conversational chatbot using LangChain's natural language processing capabilities, designed to answer user questions in real time by retrieving and generating contextually relevant answers.

2. RAG Document Q&A
Directory: 02_RAG Document Q&A
- A question-answering system that focuses on retrieving and generating answers from documents using LangChain. It leverages external data sources to provide detailed responses based on the documents queried.

3. RAG Q&A Conversion Using PDF
Directory: 03_RAG Q&A Conversion Using PDF
- This project demonstrates how LangChain integrates with PDF documents for retrieval-augmented Q&A. It parses PDF content and uses it to answer user questions, improving the efficiency of document-based searches.

4. Search Engine with LangChain Tools and Agents
Directory: 04_Search Engine With Langchain Tools And Agents
- A custom-built search engine using LangChain's tools and agents to provide accurate search results. It uses advanced retrieval methods, making it ideal for complex queries.

5. Chat SQL
Directory: 05_Chat SQL
- This project connects LangChain with SQL databases, enabling users to ask questions and receive SQL query results in a conversational format, combining the power of database management and natural language.

6. Text Summarization
Directory: 06_Text Summarization
- An implementation of text summarization using LangChain. This tool condenses long documents or text inputs into concise summaries, useful for extracting key information quickly.

7. Math & Data Search Assistant Using Google Gemma2
Directory: 07_Math & Data Search Assistant Using Google Gemma2
- A specialized assistant for math and data searches, using LangChain's integration with Google's Gemma2 to provide highly relevant information for mathematical queries and data analytics.

8. Huggingface and LangChain Integration
Directory: 08_Huggingface And Langchain Integration
- This project integrates LangChain with Huggingface's models to provide enhanced NLP capabilities, making it easy to deploy state-of-the-art models for various tasks like text classification and summarization.

10. PDF Query RAG with LangChain and AstraDB
Directory: 09_PDF Query RAG With LangChain And AstraDB
- A PDF query system built with AstraDB and LangChain, combining document retrieval with a NoSQL database for efficient querying and generation of responses from PDF documents.

10. Multi-Language Code Assistant
Directory: 10_MultiLanguage Code Assistant
- This project implements a multi-language code assistant that uses LangChain's language understanding to assist with code queries and provide help across various programming languages.

11. Crew AI Crash Course
Directory: 11_Crew-AI-Crash-course-main
- A crash course designed to introduce users to AI concepts, with hands-on examples of LangChain's RAG-based workflows for real-world applications.
